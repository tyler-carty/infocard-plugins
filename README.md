# infocard-plugins

 A collection of plugins developed for an existing code base to allow the user to store certain information.

 Every plugin deeloped by myself is found in the InfoCards2 folder, including credit card, bookmark and student ID information.

 You can open this solution in Visual Studio to view the code and run the program, otherwise the .EXE to run standalone is found at the following path:   

 Assignment\Assignment\bin\Debug\Assignment.exe
